This repository contains

1. two mechanisations of the initial algebra semantics of binding
signatures in De Bruijn monads,

  a. one in hol, with a specific example of lambda-calculus and

  b. one in coq, together with

2. a file bonus.pdf, which contains the development of a notion of
signature for programming languages sketched in the main submission.

For a more precise description of each mechanisation, please see the
corresponding subdirectories.
